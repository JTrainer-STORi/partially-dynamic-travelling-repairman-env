class PartiallyDynamicTravellingRepairmanEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    ## Description

    This environment simulates the partially dynamic travelling repairman problem described in the paper:
    ["Partially dynamic vehicle routingâ€”models and algorithms"](A Larsen, O Madsen, M Solomon)
    A Repairman must visit a set of customers, each with a specific service time and location.
    The repairman starts at a depot and must service all customers while minimizing the total travel time.
    The environment allows for a fixed number of customers, and the repairman can only service a customer once.
    The environment is partially dynamic, meaning that new customers can be added during the episode.

    ## Action Space

    The action space is discrete, where each action corresponds to a customer index (1 to `max_customers`) or the depot (0).
    The repairman can only return to the depot after servicing all customers.
    The action space is defined as follows:
    - 0: Depot (starting point)
    - 1 to `max_customers`: Customer indices (1-based, excluding depot)
    The action space is defined as a discrete space with `max_customers + 1` actions, where the first action (0) is the depot.
    The repairman can only choose an action that corresponds to a customer that has arrived and has not been visited yet.
    The action mask is used to filter out invalid actions based on the current state of the environment.
    The action mask is a boolean array of length `max_customers + 1`, where each element corresponds to an action.
    If an action is valid, the corresponding element in the mask is `True`, otherwise it is `False`.
    The action mask is updated at each step based on the current time and the arrival times of the customers.

    ## Observation Space

    The customer locations exist in a 10_000 x 10_000 m^2 grid.

    The observation space is a dictionary containing:
    - `coords`: A 2D array of shape `(max_customers + 1, 2)` representing the coordinates of the depot and customers.
      The first row corresponds to the depot, and the subsequent rows correspond to the customers.
    - `repairman_location`: A 1D array of shape `(2,)` representing the current location of the repairman in the grid.

    ## Rewards 

    The reward is the negative travel time taken to service a customer.
    The reward is calculated as the negative of the travel time taken to service a customer.
    The travel time is calculated based on the distance between the repairman's current location and the customer's location,
    and the speed of the repairman.

    ## Starting State 

    The environment starts with a random number of customers (between `min_customers` and `max_customers`) and their locations.
    A number of advanced request customers (who are available immediately) and immediate request customers (who arrive at random times) are generated according to the specified maximum and minimum degrees of dynamism (`min_dod` and `max_dod`).
    The repairman starts at the depot, which is located at the center of the grid (5000, 5000).
    The service times for each customer are sampled from a log-normal distribution with a specified mean and variance.
    The arrival times of immediate request customers are sampled uniformly from the range [60, `time_horizon` * 3600] seconds.
    The arrival times of advanced request customers are set to 0 seconds, meaning they are available immediately.

    ## Episode End

    The episode ends when all customers have been serviced and the repairman returns to the depot.

    ## Arguments 

    - `min_customers`: The minimum number of customers that must be present in the environment at any time.
    - `max_customers`: The maximum number of customers that can be present in the environment at any time.
    - `repairman_speed`: The speed of the repairman in km/h.
    - `time_horizon`: The time horizon corresponding to the latest time a new customer can arrive in hours.
    - `mean_service_time`: The mean service time for each customer in minutes (min 0).
    - `var_service_time`: The variance of the service time for each customer in minutes (truncated at 0).
    - `min_dod`: The minimum degree of dynamism, which is the proportion of requests that arrive during the episode.
    - `max_dod`: The maximum degree of dynamism
